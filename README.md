 Fuel Monitoring System

 The SmartFuel Monitoring System is a versatile firmware designed to interface with fuel level sensors and accurately measure fuel levels within a tank. This project supports a variety of Gamicos sensors, with a particular focus on the GLT510 hydrostatic sensor. It provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring fuel levels and ensuring efficient fuel management.

 Key Components:

1. Raspberry Pi 3b+: This serves as the core computing platform, handling data processing and communication tasks.
2. GLT510 Sensor: The GLT510 hydrostatic sensor is at the heart of the system, providing precise fuel level measurements.
3. USB to RS485 Converter: This interface facilitates communication between the Raspberry Pi and the GLT510 sensor via the MODBUS RTU protocol.
4. Sim7600: This component enables mobile communication, allowing for remote monitoring and data transmission.

Interface and Communication:
The system utilizes MODBUS RTU for communication with the GLT510 sensor, ensuring reliable and standardized data exchange. It offers the flexibility to connect up to 10 sensors to the RS485 line, each with a unique address ranging from 1 to 10. This scalability allows users to monitor multiple tanks or containers simultaneously.

Features and Benefits:

1. Accurate Fuel Level Monitoring: The GLT510 sensor, known for its hydrostatic measurement accuracy, ensures precise fuel level readings.
2. Scalability: The firmware supports multiple sensors, making it suitable for various monitoring scenarios.
3. Remote Monitoring: Integration with the Sim7600 module enables remote data access and real-time monitoring.
4. Data Processing: The Raspberry Pi 3b+ handles data processing efficiently, providing valuable insights into fuel consumption and tank status.

Operations of the SmartFuel Monitoring System:

1. The SmartFuel Monitoring System operates seamlessly to collect, store, and transmit fuel level data from the GLT510 sensor. Here is an overview of its operations:

2. Data Acquisition: The GLT510 hydrostatic sensor measures the fuel level within the tank. It sends real-time data to the connected Raspberry Pi 3b+ device.

3. Local Data Storage: The data received from the sensor is stored locally on the Raspberry Pi using SQLite, a lightweight and efficient relational database management system. SQLite ensures that data is organized and readily accessible for analysis.

4. Data Processing: The Raspberry Pi processes the collected data, performing necessary calculations or data transformations if required. This step can include converting raw sensor data into meaningful fuel level measurements.

5. Data Transmission: Once the data is processed and ready for transmission, the system sends it to a designated endpoint. This endpoint is typically an inverter, which may be responsible for aggregating and further processing the data.

6. Remote Monitoring: The Sim7600 module, integrated into the system, enables remote monitoring capabilities. It allows the SmartFuel Monitoring System to communicate with external endpoints over mobile networks, facilitating real-time data access and control.

7. Data Management: Both locally stored data and data transmitted to the inverter are managed by the system. This includes data retention policies, backups, and ensuring data integrity throughout its lifecycle.
